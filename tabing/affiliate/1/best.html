						<ul>
							<li><strong>Sole Proprietorship: </strong>This structure is ideal for individual entrepreneurs who want to have sole control over business decisions. However, it does not provide a legal distinction between personal and business assets, which means personal assets could be at risk in the event of business liabilities.</li>
							<li><strong>Incorporation: </strong>Incorporating your business can protect your personal assets from business liabilities and may provide tax benefits. Depending on your business goals, you can choose between different types of corporations, such as a C corporation or S corporation, each offering specific advantages regarding taxation and ownership.</li>
							<li><strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC):</strong> For many business owners, forming an LLC is a favorable option. It offers liability protection similar to a corporation but with less complexity in terms of tax and administrative requirements. Using services like ZenBusiness can simplify the process of forming an LLC, allowing you to focus more on growing your business.
